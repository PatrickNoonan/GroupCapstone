                    The option to go premium will allow business to be the first stop on our passports, therefore increasing the  <br />
                    amount of check-ins at the businesses.
                </p>
                <p>Data will be shown of how many check-in from our members that have been to your business<br /> from 7 days prior as well as 30 days prior to the current date.</p>
